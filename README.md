# todo app project 

  A todo app project where users can log in and sign up. Users can add tasks, and each task can have subtasks with checkboxes. Each checkbox corresponds to a task that a user can complete. The accordion dynamically expands and collapses to show the subtasks. Additionally, a circular progress bar is integrated within the accordion bar. This progress bar increments by 20% each time a user checks a box. When all checkboxes are marked, the progress bar displays 100%. If a checkbox is unchecked, the progress bar decrements accordingly


 On the server-side, I used the MVC architecture and utilized the MongoDB framework Mongoose, along with JWT for authentication
